# Readme

This is docker base image for MLPIPE and contains all libraries required by MLPIPE.

Our project requires Python 3.7 which is currently [not supported](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25939) by official tensorflow docker image. 
Therefore we are using images from [echoes-ai/tensorflow](https://github.com/echoes-ai/tensorflow-dockerfiles).
